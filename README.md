# RAG System Building Guide with LlamaIndex
This repository provides step-by-step instructions to create a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) and specifically focusing on VinaLLaMA for the Vietnamese language.

## Introduction
The RAG System is a powerful natural language processing model that combines the capabilities of retrieval-based and generative approaches. This guide will walk you through the process of building a custom RAG system using OpenAI API, and specifically integrating LlamaIndex for enhanced performance.

## Requirements
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- LlamaIndex library

## Features 
- Building a RAG System using OpenAI API
- Building a Custom RAG System using Starling-7B
- Building a Custom RAG System using VinaLLaMA for Vietnamese Language
- Building an advanced RAG System with
  - Sentence Window Retrieval
  - Auto-merging Retrieval
- How to evaluate a RAG System
